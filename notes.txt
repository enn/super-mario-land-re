21AF and 21FB are part of a procedure starting at 219D called cobo
cobo calls 22A0 (col) and 2318 (tile). 22A0 happens every column, 2318 only happens every block

The values ff00+E_ are global variables. List of them all across all 3 subroutines:
read only:
* ff00+A4 [R:read way too often to be relevant] [W: seems to increase every pixel]
* (lev_num) ff00+E4 [R:more often than once per block] [W: written to when you complete a level]
  This the level number (TODO: tabulate its value on each level)
* (blk_num) ff00+E5 [R:very often] [W: increases once per block]
  This is the block number
* ff00+F9 [R:too often to be relevant. wrong] [W: increases once per column, range 40 to 5F]

read & write:
* ff00+E1
* ff00+E6
* ff00+E7
* ff00+E8
* ff00+E9
* ff00+EA
* ff00+FD

So we know that cobo works out: 4000 + 2*lev_num + 2*blk_num
in level1 4000 4001 is consulted every block, and the same value 6192 is read every time
